        <h1>üåü Ceela's Cute Page üåü</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the page dedicated to my amazing stunning, funny, lovely friend: Aceel Harraby!</p>
        <p>Aceel is not just my best-friend, she's my twin in spirit üë´! We share the same birth date (üóìÔ∏è 22nd July 2006), which makes our bond even more special <span class="heart">üíñ</span>. Our "Rencontre" was the most random ever, I have accidentally spilled the tea and told her about my whole life story in one night, the night we talked about our future ambitions, my personal family issues, my break-up, her friends, how we have too much in common.</p>
        <p>One thing made me feel comfortable to talk to her is that she is too nice to be real (I always ask her if she's real or she's fictional üòÇ). She listens to me to the least minute detail. She was supportive, she even sent me a 349-word-message to support me and make me feel better (It worked <span class="heart">üíñ</span>, I actually copied it to my diary üìî and wrote a whole page about that day because it was the first time I receive such a pure help from a random person).</p>
        <p>Ceela went from a random unknown Instagram Follower to the person I would love to talk to for the whole 86400 seconds everyday. I can remember the late night talks together, and the funny moments we had, they may be little unremarkable details, but they mean a lot to me. Since I'm a Computers' Geek and only good at coding, I felt I can express my gratitude to her by dedicating some time (30 hours üòÇ) to create this cute thing for her as a long distance friend. I hope you love it Assoula ü´∂. You're the best!! <span class="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è</span></p>
        <p>I made this website to show how much special she is to me and make her feel proud of herself. You will find details and facts about her here and some pictures I found on her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aceel_hr/" title="Aceel's Instagram Account" target="_blank">Instagram Account</a>.</p>
        <p>(I am not a stalker ü•∑)</p>
